He revealed how he thought she was way out of his league, but he finally took courage and decided to ask her out. To his surprise, she accepted his offer.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"I had $1000 to my name and for our first date, I wasn't sure what she would want to do, so I took out all the money from my bank account," he recollected. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Luckily, Title was not expensive to date and they went to a restaurant in New York City called Cafe Centrale where a young John Goodman, the-then aspiring actor,&nbsp;was their bartender.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Alexander and Title clicked almost immediately and things started moving quite fast from there as they started living together within three weeks of their date.</p><p>He asked her to marry her but she almost instantly said no.

He finally expressed his love through a billboard in the Time Square where he wrote, "Daena, I love you. Marry me. Forever, Jason".</p><p>They exchanged vows on May 31, 1981, and&nbsp;have been together for nearly four decades as they marked their 40th anniversary in May 2021.</p><h2>Jason Alexander On His Wife Daena E. Titleâ€™s Artistic Pursuits</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Daena is an established actor that has taken a variety of roles. She made her acting debut in 1995 when she appeared in an American television sitcom, For Better or Worse than Cop#2. Later, she performed in Seinfeld in&nbsp;1998, and in Just Looking in 1999. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The actress, however, is also known for having outstanding artistic talents as she has been pursuing her artistic expressions since the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>During his stint in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> by the Jewish Journal, <a href=# rel=follow>Alexander</a>&nbsp;talked about his wife's latest series, "Drown the Dolls," a collection of photographs and paintings of Barbie Dolls being submerged underwater.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander explained her interest in creating juxtapositions&nbsp;of real images and abstractions on the same canvas.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Going underwater, everything kind of comes out real and hard-edged and realistic. But the surface becomes this amazing palette of distortions and kaleidoscope," he said. "With her series, she was able to suddenly see a single frame with photographs of real and abstract images."</p><p>He also shed some light on how her artistic talents were suddenly unveiled 12 years into their marriage and that she went after her passion only after the birth of their first child.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>His wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Title</a>, elaborated on the topic and said that after her graduation from college, she entered the industry as an actress, shutting all her passion for painting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"After graduation, I became an actress. Didnâ€™t quite get the love there. So, I became a screenwriter. Ehhh, not so much there either. I worked hard at it, but it was always more work than joy." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With the start of her family and the birth of her son, everything restarted for her and suddenly, she knew on an instinctive, "deep animal level" that she needed to create again. She suddenly started to draw and to paint. And the rest is history!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRqLyvecClnLGZnpmys3nWop2eZZuesbR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./joe-wicks-body-coach-rare-photo-of-children.html>&#171;&nbsp;Joe Wicks shares rare photo of children Indie, 1, and three month old Marley</a>
