Indeed, Zion is the son of none other than Floyd Mayweather. Today we are here to talk about Floyd’s son, personal life, and daily fun-filled adventure recorded on social media!</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts width=643><tbody readability=2.9235127478754><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Zion Shamaree Mayweather</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>22 Years Old</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth:</th><td>March 28, 2001</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Place of Birth:</th><td>The United States of America</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Parents</th><td>Floyd Mayweather (Father); Josie Harris (Mother)</td></tr><tr><th>Married/Girlfriend</th><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><th>Siblings:</th><td>Koraun and Jiran Mayweather</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media:</th><td><a href=#>Instagram</a></td></tr><tr><th>Last Update:</th><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather Wiki-Bio | Early Life & Ethnicity | Who Is Josie Harris?</h2><p>On March 28, 2001, <span>Zion Shamaree Mayweather was born</span><span> in Cleveland, Ohio, the United States of America.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, being born in America naturally makes him an American citizen and belongs to black ethnicity.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/zion-930.jpg><p>Also, it is necessary to say again, as we already know who Shamaree’s father is. But, many didn’t probably know who the Queen was of the Mayweather house. Zion’s mom and Floyd’s wife is the late <strong>Josie Harris.</strong></p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Ray Leonard Worth: Career Earnings, House, Lifestyle &amp;#038; Assets >></a></strong></h4><h2>How did Josie die?</h2><p>Zion Shamaree Mayweather relished a close bond with his mom and siblings.</p><p>This must have been really hard and frustrating to lose his mother in such cloudy circumstances on the 10th of March 2020.</p><p>She was said to have been found completely irresponsive in her driveway.</p><p>Josie Harris was sentenced dead by paramedics called to the police scene, who found her unresponsive in her car.</p><p>TMZ’s first-ever report was that there was no proof that she died of a drug suicide, although doctors made a statement that she died of a drug overdose.</p><p>Zion has had several pics of his mom on his IG page and his siblings, where he refers to them as his best friends.</p><p>Before she passed away, his mother is known to drop several comments on his Instagram posts. She loved him fiercely and called him a ‘warrior.’</p><p>In the same way, we would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to the mourning family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/zion-931.jpg><p>On the other hand, the death of her mother left the entire Mayweather family heartbroken. However, in the company of his siblings, <strong>Koraun</strong> and <strong>Jiran,</strong> we hope Zion can overcome this terrible loss.</p><p>Similarly, the young Mayweather attended West Ranch High School, along with his brother and sister. Despite having a lifetime of wealth, Floyd knows the value of education and its impact.</p><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in 2001, Shamaree is 18 years old at present. In like manner, after stepping into adult life, the young Mayweather wants to be more independent of his father and make a name for himself.</p><p>Added to that, Zion stands at the height of 5’6″ (1.73 m), almost as tall as his father, and also weighs a proper 58kg (128 lb). Although he is still growing, Shamaree has a lean, ectomorphic build and may put on muscles like his father shortly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/zion-932.jpg><p>Likewise, the horoscope chart suggests that the young Mayweather is an Aries. Zion seems motivated, passionate, and oozes confidence about the zodiac, and even his Instagram suggests his cheerful, positive nature.</p><p>Similarly, the most distinguishable factor about Shamaree is his dreadlocked hair, mildly freckled skin, and a smile that shows off his retainer.</p><h2>Zion’s relationship with his father</h2><p>Despite his parent’s bond’s bitterness, it’s almost shocking that it hasn’t colored Zion’s bond with his dad.</p><p>The duo resembles getting along quite well, and it has been criticized a lot that Zion might be his dad’s very ideal.</p><p>While Zion has decided not to pursue a boxing career for matters left to him, he will enjoy a close bond with his dad.</p><p>A few years earlier, during his 16th birthday, the news was going around that his dad threw him a big party and called upon several personalities or, in simple words, celebrities, including Young Thug.</p><p>Zion was also said to have been getting a beautiful Mercedes C-Class Coupe worth around £31,000 by his dad. He has numerous posts on his Instagram page celebrating his father and declaring his love for him without any hesitation.</p><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather Career | What Does Zion Do For Living?</h2><p>In particular, it is unclear what Mayweather does for a living. Accordingly, many sources pointed out his lavish lifestyle as an indicator of being an influencer, but we highly doubt it.</p><p>Likewise, in one instance, many sources claimed that Zion is following the footsteps of his father.&nbsp; Even though we won’t shrug off the possibility, his online presence does not indicate his passion for boxing, apart from supporting Mayweather Sr.’s career.</p><p>Nonetheless, whatever Shamaree intends to achieve or aim for, the entire Mayweather fanbase is rooting for him. Further, we wish him much success in his career endeavors. As we find out more, the section will be updated as such.</p><h2>Why did Zion’s parents part?</h2><p>His parent’s relationship finally toppled in 2010 after his mom(Josie Harris) blamed his father (Floyd) for insulting her in front of the children.</p><p>Floyd subserved 90 days in the county jail, ended 100 hours of community service, paid a fine of $2,500, and was made to attend a 12-month domestic-violence program.</p><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather Net Worth | Heir To The Mayweather Fortune</h2><p>First, we don’t have many reliable sources to attest to the truth behind Zion’s net worth. However, we can truthfully say that the Mayweather children enjoy a wealthy lifestyle their father, Floyd, provides them.</p><p>In like manner, if we take a look at Floyd’s Instagram, the former boxer lives a life of luxury. There is no form of disparity to be seen in Floyd’s life. Also, the retired legend has an eye-popping net worth of<strong> $505 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/zion-933.jpg><p>Further, Mayweather Sr. amassed total career earnings of<strong> $1.1 billion</strong>. The numbers do not digest easily, do they? Don’t worry; we are shaking like you. Also, the legendary boxer received <strong>$300 million</strong> in payment per fight. Per fight.</p><p>Gradually, the lifestyle of the Mayweather family is exquisite. Since Daddy Mayweather has several business ventures and uncountable sources to generate revenue, Zion, Koraun, and Jiran have nothing to fear for in the future.</p><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather Dating | Relationship Status</h2><p>For instance, the 18-year-old is not dating anyone at present. If he were in a relationship with anyone, the internet would explode at the revelation.</p><p>Nonetheless, at a point in his life, rumors circulated of him having an affair with someone from high school. Even though it cannot corroborate, we cannot corroborate.</p><p>He cannot corroborate the level of truth behind it. We can assume it to be a short-term fling and nothing serious.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: 220k followers (@zion_mayweather)</p><h2>Zion Shamaree Mayweather | Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do people still taunt Zion’s dad for his relationship with Josie?</h3><p>People taunted him a lot for abusing Josie.
