John broke the news at a private ceremony, saying it was a “wonderful day” and that, despite being unable to sleep, he is feeling better after being in the hospital for a long period. Those in attendance instantly shared the news on social media, expressing their joy for the pair.</p><p>Chrissy and John had been anticipating the birth of their child for quite some time. In an interview with People last year, John said that everyone is delighted and that his two older children are old enough to comprehend what is going on and are eager to have a new brother.</p><p>Chrissy previously said that the pair chose IVF and got positive news after nine days. She said to the publication:</p><p>“They knew I was going in for the transfer, that we were going in and putting this egg into Mommy’s tummy. So they understood from the start, and they knew there was a risk it wouldn’t succeed since it had occurred before.”</p><p>Chrissy said that her children were delighted and that this would be their longest pregnancy when she announced her pregnancy in August 2022.</p><h2>John Legend and Chrissy Teigen have been married since 2013.</h2><p>Chrissy Teigen and John Legend initially met in 2006 while filming for Legend’s music video, Stereo. Teigen said in an interview with Cosmopolitan that they reconnected in 2014.&nbsp;The two stayed in touch for a long period, and Legend was seen on the red carpet at several events with other ladies. Teigen remarked in an interview with Cosmopolitan:</p><p>“For a time, I let him be himself. The worst thing you can do is attempt to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, ‘There’s so much more out there. I kept my cool for a long time.’ I never once asked, ‘Who are we?’ Marriage was never my objective since I was never a typical person. I was really relieved to be with him.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chrissy-Teigen-1.jpg alt="Chrissy Teigen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kanye West and Stevie Wonder were among the celebrities that attended the couple’s wedding in 2013. They had their daughter Luna in April 2016 and their son Miles in May 2018.&nbsp;Legend said in an interview with Today in 2018 that he and Teigen appreciate each other and enjoy each other’s presence. Teigen makes him laugh all the time, he says, and she is attentive and kind with the finest sense of humor.</p><h2>Chrissy Teigen miscarried in 2020.</h2><p>Due to pregnancy problems, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend lost their third child in 2020. Teigen also shared some hospital photos and said that she had to make some difficult choices after finding that the baby would not live.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“It became evident around halfway through that he would not survive, and that I would not either if no medical help was provided.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chrissy-Teigen-2.jpg alt="Chrissy Teigen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chrissy Teigen revealed in a blog post a few weeks before her loss that she had been induced to birth her kid 20 weeks after being diagnosed with partial placental abruption. She recounted that her bleeding worsened and she was admitted to the hospital. Doctors tried blood transfusions, but they had little effect on the condition.&nbsp;Teigen said that her loss was an abortion at a conference session after the reversal of the Roe versus Wade verdict.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaqZqMC6edOeoKCdnmKur7CMo6ahpl2hsqixzZ1ksJ2cmLyuscNmq6Gdmad6tbTIq5tmm5ieuaV7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./disgusted-mum-begs-help-bed-worms-mattress.html>&#171;&nbsp;Disgusted mum begs for help after finding bed worms slithering out of her mattress &amp;amp; its more com</a>
