series, including The Bodyguard, Message in a Bottle, Dragonfly, Hidden Figures, and recently, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yellowstone</a>, but he’s also a father to seven incredible kids. He welcomed his children, who include daughters<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Annie</strong></a>,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Lily</strong> </a>and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Grace</strong></a>, and sons, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe</strong></a>, <strong>Liam</strong>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cayden</strong></a> and <strong>Hayes</strong>, throughout three different relationships over the years. And although he’s said there are challenges to having <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“two sets of children”</a> in the past, he’s also talked about the joy and uniqueness of his oldest and youngest being 26 years apart.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“As [my] children interact together, there’s always this little bit of, ‘Do you care for us now as much as you do them?’ That’s just a natural thing that happens, and you have to talk about how big love is,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mom.com</a>&nbsp;in 2015. “The ability to be able to love somebody else doesn’t mean there’s less love for you. Love seems to be always able to hang on to as many people as needs to be in that circle.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kevin puts his kids as a main priority. He spoke about needing to take his kids out of school as floods hit Santa Barbara and he needed to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>skip the Golden Globes</a> in January 2023. “Yesterday, we had to pull the kids out of school in Santa Barbara. For the second time in five years, the freeways are flooded out,” he said in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> video. “We couldn’t get back to the house with the freeways closed. No one is sadder than us that we can’t be there at the Golden Globes.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>His loving and compassionate attitude, however, doesn’t carry over to his gruff Yellowstone character John Dutton. In a recent extended teaser interview, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Whiskeyriff</a>, the longtime actor says Dutton hates insecurity and “weakness” in his children. “John is an aggressive personality and doesn’t like weakness, and he doesn’t wanna see it in his children,” he said. “It’s family, it’s a dysfunctional family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>To that end, he’s also spoken out about why he doesn’t want his kids to watch the series. “It’s too naughty for them to see and they probably do figure out how to see it. But it’s got some nasty little bits that are good fun for everybody else,” he reportedly told Extra. “Listen, a lot of my movies have some of those themes, so they’re going to find them in the course of their life. I hope they find ‘Fandango.’ I hope they figure out what I’ve been doing with my life. I’m their dad for sure.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Despite the show’s success, there have also been some rumors that Kevin may be stepping away from the series. Sources have claimed that the actor is considering leaving&nbsp;Yellowstone to focus on other projects, according to report from&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. While nothing has been confirmed, there have also been rumors of a&nbsp;<strong>Matthew McConaughey-</strong>led spinoff. A Paramount spokesperson said that there was “no news” in a statement to the outlet. “Kevin Costner is a big part of&nbsp;Yellowstone and we hope that’s the case for a long time to come. Thanks to the brilliant mind of Taylor Sheridan, we are always working on franchise expansions of this incredible world he has built. Matthew McConaughey is a phenomenal talent with whom we’d love to partner,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Find out more about Kevin’s seven children, from oldest to youngest, below.</p><h2><span><span>Annie & </span></span><span><span>Lily</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kevin-Costner-kids-shutterstock-post-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Annie Costner</strong> is Kevin’s oldest child.
