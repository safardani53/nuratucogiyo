The recruits were directed to break up into teams and carry a boat across rough terrain before sailing it across a lake. When Rizzo broke down mid-mission, her team leader,&nbsp; Cameron, 30, reached out a helping hand.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Tyler, at the very end, I just remember crumpling a little,” Rizzo exclusively told Us Weekly about her final challenge. “I was a puddle of a human on the floor, and he picked me up and gave me this big hug. And I just remember sobbing into his chest because I was just so emotional, and he was just being so kind. I remember just being like, ‘Tyler, you’re amazing. Thank you.’”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Rizzo — who was married to <a href=#>Bob Saget</a> for six years before his death in January 2022 — shared that Cameron, 30, “hugged” her to stop her from “convulsing” and urged her to keep pushing ahead.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I just remember sobbing into his chest because it was this moment of kindness between teammates,” she said. “He was just really wanting to be supportive and wanting me to keep going. He didn’t want me to give up.”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Rizzo noted that <a href=#>while Cameron was a pillar of strength</a>, Sandoval, 40, took the “opposite” approach. “Tom yelled at me,” she recalled. “He’s like, ‘If you quit now you’re letting your team down.’ And I was like, ‘Shut up Tom.’”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Special Forces star admitted that <a href=#>while the two men took “opposite approaches,”</a> it was a “really intense” moment for everyone — and Sandoval often got the brunt of the heat from the directing staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“They <a href=#>were being really hard on Tom [Sandoval]</a>, they were giving him zero emotional love,” she told Us of the Vanderpump Rules star who previously revealed he joined the series to “take a beating” after cheating on ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> with costar <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tyler-Cameron-Jokes-He-Doesnt-Regret-Breaking-Up-With-Any-of-His-Exes-Im-Glad-They-All-Went-Away-feature.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Rizzo, however, felt the DS team was always “rooting” for her no matter how in her face they may have seemed.
