made headlines when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he spent the team's bye week</a> working behind the counter at a fast-food restaurant. The now 24-year-old said he wanted to ensure he had on-the-job experience in his back pocket for when his football career ends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Said Hines to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Indianapolis Star</a> at the time, "Let's be real. You could play the next game and get hit and never play again. That's sad to think about, but you have to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He's not the only athlete thinking about the next step. According to data from LinkedIn Talent Insights, there are more than 11,000 "professional athletes" in the U.S. seeking connections on the business and employment online service. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The phenomenon was recently highlighted in a piece by the New York Times last December.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're often introduced to athletes when they're scoring points and winning games. But on LinkedIn, pro athletes reintroduce themselves in a light in which the public doesn't often see them," LinkedIn News Editor Joseph Milord tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For some, that starts after they're done playing professionally, while for others, it's earlier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephen Tulloch, who was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in 2006 and ended his career with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017, is just one of many NFL players who have made the transition from the sport to more everyday occupations. Tulloch, 36, now owns the successful <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Circle House Coffee</a> in Fort Lauderdale (and is opening a second location) but not all football players have an easy transition away from the multi-million dollar paying career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"During my playing career, every offseason I'd go on LinkedIn, and I'd reach out to different businesses. And I'd reach out to the owners of these companies and I'd say, 'Look, I'm Stephen Tulloch of the Detroit Lions, I want to meet with you over lunch and just kind of talk to you about your business,' " Tulloch tells PEOPLE. "And these people opened the doors for me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that almost 78 percent of NFL players either go bankrupt or undergo financial strain within two years of retiring, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>according to The Undefeated.</a> Tulloch is aware of the stat, telling PEOPLE, "it's a growing and a concerning number, and we have to find a way to kind of minimize that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former linebacker says his post-football career was always front of mind during his 11 years in the NFL, and he attended the league's Business Academy. The league boasts <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a slate of professional development</a> opportunities, from a real estate workshop to an entrepreneurship program to a public speaking workshop. "NFL clubs and the league office each have a Player Engagement department," an NFL spokesperson told PEOPLE. "Heads of Player Engagement serve as a key resource in assisting players with their off-field professional development during and beyond their NFL experiences."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tulloch admits that he's not sure many players take advantage of the programs, though.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Stephen Tulloch.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>George Gojkovich/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[They] basically introduce different avenues that people, in this case players, might want to direct their energy to after football, whether it's real estate, whether it's financing, opening up your own business, or entrepreneurship," he explains. "There's different sectors within that program that gear to particular students, in regard to what it is they want to ultimately do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The opportunities now, are much different than when Emmitt Smith was a player, he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith, who spent 15 seasons in the NFL, tells PEOPLE, "They do a better job today than they did, in my opinion, back in the nineties. And so I think the players should be a little more astute, a little more equipped to deal with [the post-football transition]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 51-year-old retired back in 2005 after spending most of his career with the Dallas Cowboys. He now serves as president and CEO of Emmitt Smith Enterprises, an umbrella that includes his real estate solutions and services provider <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>E Smith Advisors</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith says he "started the process" of building a post-football career "from day one."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was extremely frugal with everything," he recounts now. "I was eager to learn and ask questions in my rookie year. I had friends that had businesses already, and so I was asking questions about businesses. I was looking into franchise ownerships."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Dancing with the Stars winner began investing in real estate and franchises, so that "once I approached retirement, I made it. It was very clear what I wanted to do and what I was passionate about and how I could best leverage myself. And that was one of the ways I did it."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Emmitt Smith playing for the Florida Gators.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Allen Dean Steele/Allsport/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Smith and Tulloch can see how their football careers have helped — and hindered — their professional development outside of the league.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It helped with brand recognition and name recognition," Smith says of the NFL. "So yes, you can get into a door, but yet at the same time, I think it hurts because everyone wants to figure out how to leverage you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He adds, "Here's the thing about being an NFL player or professional athlete, your relationships are mainly through sports. And when you retire, you have to build a totally different relationship based in the business world. Not only that, but then you have to prove yourself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That name recognition Smith mentions, can be a double-edged sword, according to Tulloch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's one thing for somebody to take my name and type it in Google, and they can see how much I've made throughout my career, what I've done. They know my whole life," he explains. "But what I can do is be transparent in my change of careers, and kind of exemplify what I did during my career through [the charitable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Stephen Tulloch Foundation</a>], what I'm doing with my coffee, — giving back to people through coffee — and just kind of let people absorb that and understand that this is who I am, this is what I'm about."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of that has been made possible by LinkedIn. Tulloch has a personal page, he says, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a business page for this coffee shop</a>, Circle House. The platform is a source, he says, for him to get in touch with people not in his usual circles, eventually opening up doors for collaboration and growth. And through his business page, he's connecting with potential employees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smith admits that it can be difficult to filter through connection requests on LinkedIn when you have a name as recognizable as his: "I'm looking at what's real and what's not, who is actually trying to connect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, Smith has developed a system for finding opportunities that are the best fit for both his companies, and his personal brand — like speaking engagements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And more and more athletes are realizing that potential.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Some of our most notable members, like NBA champion and investor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Andre Iguodala</a>, have often said the new-age athlete is much more business-savvy," LinkedIn's Milord tells PEOPLE. "There is no other platform on which conversations about business, professional, networking, career-building have more of a place than LinkedIn. So, it's not surprising that they see using LinkedIn as a great way to prepare for and transition into what's next, or unveil a major new project (as NBA All-Star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Luka Doncic</a> just did when he became the global chief hydration officer for BioSteel)."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Smith and Tulloch, business is thriving — even amid a tumultous year when companies across the country struggled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For us, this isn't a coffee shop. What we provide is the first and only drive-through coffee shop in Ft. Lauderdale," Tulloch says of his Circle House, which also highlights charities in the local community every month and gives back to them. "We created that vibe and that feel for people that when they come in, they're on a first name basis. We know what they need, we know what our customers want, and we can fill their needs and make them feel good, or even better when they walk out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Tulloch, Smith is also using his success to give back, which he tells PEOPLE, is a no-brainer. He knows his background gets him through doors that others might never reach. "You have the chance to help that person, whether it's through financial means, through our charity or whether it's through words of wisdom and advice and experience here," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reflecting, both insist that current players shouldn't "wait until the end of their careers to prepare themselves" for the future, in Smith's words. He encourages NFL athletes to spend their offseasons getting educated in career fields of their interest, seek internships, and, most importantly, save money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've been a player," Tulloch tells PEOPLE. "I left school early as a junior, I know what it is to take on $800,000 as a 21-year-old kid, and to make millions as you go through your career, and how to hold onto it as you leave the league. ... I've done it, so I think for guys, they have to understand that you're not going to be getting these hundred thousand dollar checks every week. It's going to die out one day, and you have to prepare now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0miln6RdpbmixcSrqmato567qHnLoqWknZSeu26txa2cq2WimsGqvsRmnKalmanBbr%2FMoquhZaOpsrG0xKdkra2cobyktI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eva-mendes-supports-ryan-gosling-im-just-ken-holiday-version-barbie-video-8417943.html>&#171;&nbsp;Eva Mendes Shows Support for Ryan Gosling's Kenergy in Music Studio</a>
