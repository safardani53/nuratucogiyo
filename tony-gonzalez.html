He made roughly $6 million per year on average during his final two years with the Atlanta Falcons. However, his current compensation as a Fox Sports pundit is unclear.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>His athletic career began in his final year of high school when he excelled in both basketball and football. He was even named Orange County High School Athlete of the Year with golfer Tiger Woods.&nbsp;His time at the University of California, where he played football and basketball, boosted his career.&nbsp;He excelled at both, but ultimately chose football over basketball as a profession.</p><p>In the 1997 NFL Draft, Gonzalez was rated as one of the best tight ends. In the 1997 season, he made his NFL debut. Tony had a productive season, ending with 33 catches, two touchdowns, and a blocked punt on different teams, and was chosen to the NFL All-Rookie team. He improved substantially in the following seasons, receiving First Team All-Pro honors and three straight Pro-Bowl selections in 1999, 2000, and 2001.&nbsp;He was the most productive tight end in the NFL from 2003 through 2006.&nbsp;In 2004, he set an NFL record (for a tight end) with 102 receptions for 1258 yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p>Later that year, he became the NFL’s all-time leader in receiving yards for a tight end, a position he maintains to this day.&nbsp;Then, in April of 2009, he was moved to the Atlanta Falcons, and although he had a nice season, it wasn’t as good as his prior seasons, and he was not picked for the Pro Bowl for the first time in ten years. He played in 2011 and 2012, but at the conclusion of the season, he was thinking about quitting.&nbsp;He returned for one more season in 2013, but it would be his last, as he announced his retirement from the game on December 30, 2013.&nbsp;Gonzalez is recognized as an all-time great in American football, and many believe him to be the finest tight end to ever play the game.</p><h2>Tony Gonzalez Wife & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Tony Gonzalez’s wife? </b>Tony Gonzalez has a wife. October Gonzalez is his current wife.&nbsp;She is an actress best recognized for her roles in “Modern Family,” “Play It Forward,” and “Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World.”&nbsp;They have been married for 13 years, having exchanged wedding vows in July 2007.</p><p>They have been together since 2003 and had three children: two girls, River and Malia, and a boy, Niko.&nbsp;The pair met when October was working at a pub and began dating after a time.&nbsp;Tony had at least three ex-wives before meeting in October, but none of them lasted more than a year.&nbsp;Lauren Sanchez and Shannon Malone are among his ex-wives.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKapYrSwutmao56yXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./famke-janssen.html>&#171;&nbsp;Famke Janssen Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Partner, Film Industry Career</a>
