I’m facing prison time for the charges I have.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>June’s</a> new companion was also arrested for alleged domestic assault on September 29th&nbsp;of 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun has exclusively obtained those court documents as well as Jordan’s mugshot stemming from that alleged incident.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the case file, Jordan was arrested after his girlfriend at the time called the cops around 4:15am after they had gotten into an argument.&nbsp;</p><p>His girlfriend in the arrest&nbsp;report&nbsp;had alleged that “he became angry with her and broke some things in the house and punched the garage door.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The arrest report&nbsp;continued that the girlfriend told police she “was scared of him because he would not allow her to leave the house to call 911 for help and that he broke a chair in their bedroom near where she was.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a written affidavit which was submitted as part of the court's case file, the girlfriend at the time also claimed that&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;“went to drug rehab, but left,” as part of her reasoning for requesting a protective order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In that incident Jordan was charged with domestic violence and the former girlfriend, who The Sun will not identify as she was the alleged victim, was granted a temporary protective order against the 24-year-old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That case went to a bench trial, and according to court documents, Jordan did not show up and the protective order was made permanent. The case was disposed in January of 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is unclear whether the 24-year-old entered a plea in that case and if he’s ever publicly addressed the domestic violence charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun has reached out to Jordan’s attorney for comment.&nbsp;</p><h4>A RECENT RUN-IN WITH THE LAW</h4><p>The Sun also recently revealed that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">police were called to the Alabama home that June is renting on July 26th for a welfare check on Jordan</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An officer who had responded to the call at the rented two-bedroom love nest said: “We had made contact with Jordan McCollum at that address on July 26th&nbsp;after a concerned relative called police asking to do a welfare check on&nbsp;him."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The officer revealed he had believed a woman named&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">June Shannon</a>&nbsp;answered the door, and confirmed the <a href=#>person fit the description of Mama June</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I spoke with Jordan and we asked her to stay inside. We spoke to Jordan to see if he was okay- and he said he was okay. He seemed fine, so we left,” the officer added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=#>The Sun first exclusively reported,&nbsp;June rented an Alabama home for the troubled influencer, and even bought him two cars</a> after&nbsp;her split from longtime boyfriend Geno Doak, 45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One source claimed the reality star is "so into" her younger man, who is a single dad to a young daughter and a fellow recovering addict.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"She really wanted to be public about their relationship, but Jordan has tried to keep things more low-key," the insider said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>JUST FRIENDS?</h4><p>June has since hit out at fans who said they were dating. She recently commented in a&nbsp;popular&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook fan page</a>&nbsp;“Mama June: Road to Redemption,” about her relationship with the young man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “Yes&nbsp;with <a href=#>me and Jordan best friends</a> most certainly, are we in a romantic relationship, no, he is the same age is Jessica and yes is he a special part of my life, yes he is.</p><p>"Do we communicate all the time yes, but just because I’m a female and he’s a male does not mean that we have a romantic relationship," she wrote in comments section under an article that was shared from The Sun.</p><h4><strong>GENEROUS JUNE</strong></h4><p>While June addressed the nature of her relationship with Jordan,&nbsp;she has yet to address anything about the pricey gifts she has bestowed upon him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the Sun&nbsp;reported, she&nbsp;purchased&nbsp;a 2013 Nissan Altima for Jordan and then a 2019 model after the first car broke down, an insider claimed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan has bragged about the pricey new gifts- which the source said cost a total of about $40,000- on his social media pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In one&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;post, Jordan boasted: “So someone&nbsp;very special&nbsp;to me bought me a car today!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan added a purple heart and a cute face emoji to the July 17&nbsp;post, in which he shared various snaps of the 2013 Nissan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He shared a photo of the newest car in a post on August 2&nbsp;and explained: “Late update but Sally had a bad transmission so everyone&nbsp;meet&nbsp;Spade!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In that post, Mama left a comment with a slew of red hearts that read: “You deserve it, and that’s a sexy car.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the source said that Jordan is living in a two-bedroom home on a&nbsp;cul-de-sac&nbsp;rented by June that she also&nbsp;furnished&nbsp;for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>MAMA'S MOVED ON&nbsp;</h4><p>June recently announced that she had broken up with her longtime love Geno, just as he began&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">serving his sentence&nbsp;on drug charges</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">"Geno&nbsp;has been out of my life for a while now,”</a>&nbsp;June said on Instagram Live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>June has had her own run-ins with the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>June and Geno were arrested outside of an Alabama gas station for crack cocaine possession in March 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, The Sun exclusively reported that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Geno had been sentenced to 16 months</a>&nbsp;for the crime after June&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">avoided any jail</a>&nbsp;time and received community service instead.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000674147702-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000477138239-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZWiFeHyXaKSapZFit7a6xGaZqLGWp7amusNmmKuqlajBtHnGrqVmnJ%2BisrTAyJxkr6GfobKvr8Ro</p></div><div id=links><a href=./meghan-mccain-and-ben-domenech-are-expecting-their-second-child.html>&#171;&nbsp;Meghan McCain And Ben Domenech Are Expecting Their Second Child</a>
