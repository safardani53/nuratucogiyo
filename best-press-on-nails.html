With her work donning the perfectly manicured hands of clients like Beyoncé, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>JLo</a>, and Gigi Hadid, Gerstein knows how the right set of nails can make or break a look. But when you’re on the go, a quick option is always preferable. “When you don’t have the time to sit for extravagant nail art (or the money), press-ons are a great option,” Gerstein says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team spent the day trying on 13 of the most popular nail sets so you don’t have to.

Our team liked the natural and classy look of the nails, as well as the shape and size of each nail. A bit of a Goldilocks nail — this set wasn’t too long or short, too round or square — it was just right.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These nails earned a near-perfect score for application and overall look, meaning we thought the quality replicated what you’d find at a salon with the ease of home application. And these nails held their own even after testing was complete. We wore these nails for over a week, doing household tasks like laundry and washing the dishes, and only one nail popped off during that time. That’s like running a marathon in stilettos and only scuffing one rather than breaking a heel; not too shabby.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To remove, we opted not to soak the nails but rather just peel them off — which took about 15 minutes. Our only complaint was the glue, which sometimes stuck on the top of the nail and made the application slightly messy (though simple to accomplish!).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we believe any of the Static Nails press-on nail sets are an ideal option for at-home manicures because they offer a variety of sleek designs, shapes/sizes, are easy to apply and remove, and are long-lasting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Damage-Free: </strong>Yes | <strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes | <strong>Reusable:</strong> Yes (up to 18 days or 6 times for shorter wear) | <strong>Customizable:</strong> Yes, multiple sizes, shapes, and colors |<strong> Finish:</strong> Varies | <strong>Adhesive:</strong> Glue | <strong>Included Tools: </strong>Dual-sided file/buffer, glue</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-dashing-diva-magicpress-solid-colors-press-on-nails></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dashing Diva MagicPress Press-On Nails</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dashing Diva Magic Press On" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6eP6L5uzIr3_riZQD9PfORfglLM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign49-6e0c2b5633f84883a84b46ffaa970635.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dashing Diva</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>They feel lightweight on your fingertips, but they maintain a strong adhesive.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It comes with all the tools you’ll need, so the set is easy to prep and apply.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Earning a perfect score in every test we ran, the Dashing Diva nails are lightweight on your fingers but durable enough to last. These nails were easy to prep and had a strong adhesive that kept them in place. They didn’t falter after repeated hand-washing and lightly bending the edge of the nail to test the adhesive. We loved the look and felt they were comparable to salon-quality nails. The glossy finish was also a hit with our PEOPLE editorial team — so much so that deputy beauty editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jackie Fields chose this press-on nail brand as her favorite recent beauty launch</a> in our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>summer PEOPLE StyleWatch issue</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only slight inconvenience is that these nails aren’t reusable, so once they fall off, they can’t simply be reapplied. However, the set comes with 30 nails in 12 sizes, a prep pad, a nail file, and a wooden manicure stick to help with the application. Given the price (and ease of replacement!), we think these nails are a solid choice for those on a budget who want salon-quality nails at a reasonable price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Damage-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Reusable: </strong>No | <strong>Customizable: </strong>Yes,<strong> </strong>multiple sizes, shapes, and colors |<strong> Finish:</strong> Shiny |<strong> Adhesive: </strong>Pre-glued adhesive nail tab | <strong>Included Tools:</strong> Prep pad, nail file, wooden stick</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-kit-olive--june-press-on-system></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Kit</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olive & June Press-On System</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olive &amp;amp; June Press-On System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/x6-Ti3hkpwPrVmPAn2Jr_VgthM0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign50-9046b09c0348454ca6b8a76bf61adb71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Olive & June</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>This comes as a set with grooming tools, a removal kit, and a pouch to keep everything organized.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The nails are sturdy and made from recycled materials.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a little extra oomph on your nails, look to Olive & June The Press-On System. Going above a single set of nails, this kit provides high-quality press-on nails, a host of nail grooming tools and serums, a removal kit, and a pouch to keep it all organized. We loved the design and sheen of these nails, as well as the sturdy material, which is made from 94 percent post-consumer recycled materials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With top scores in most of our tests, this set of nails survived the sink test and remained in place after our team washed their hands three times. We chose to soak our nails when we were ready to remove them, and the process took about 25 to 30 minutes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only hiccup was the glue involved in the application process — which created a bit of a mess. We only struggled to apply one out of 10 nails, and the others adhered easily. We think this set is a great choice for people who want to create high-quality manicures at home. And for those who want the quality of O&J nails without the extra tools, you can buy a single pack of nails at retailers like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Target</a> for less.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Damage-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Reusable: </strong>Yes | <strong>Customizable:</strong> Yes, multiple sizes, shapes, and colors |<strong> Finish:</strong> Varies |<strong> Adhesive:</strong> Glue | <strong>Included Tools:</strong> Pouch, glue, nail clipper, file, buffer, cuticle pusher, cuticle serum, nail strengthener, removal kit</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-damage-free-manime-stick-on-gels></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Damage-Free</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ManiMe Stick-On Gels</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon ManiMe Stick-On Gels" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4CuG-pCBPs0_eGDfznhE4cBd_BI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ManiMe-Stick-On-Gels-5e24f995ef214e969d43e31a9263b72e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>They are completely damage-free and long-lasting.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The nails come in a variety of fun patterns and designs.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They stayed on after multiple rounds of washing with hot water — and even after the shower.<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the trickiest parts of press-on nails is ensuring you don’t damage your nails in the process, and these nails from ManiMe ensure an easy application and removal. Despite being stick-ons (no glue needed) these nails hold up surprisingly well against water and everyday use. They stayed on after multiple rounds of washing with hot water and even after the shower, our team observed. To remove them, you should soak them in hot soapy water for about 10 minutes before peeling them off. Acetone works to remove any residue as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only flaw we could find is when you buy the sample sizes, they are harder to apply for a perfect fit. While our testing team used the sample sizes, the custom option fits much more seamlessly. All you have to do is send in a photo of your nails and the press-ons are 3-D-printed to match. You can also modify the fit with nail clippers and seal with a top coat for a glossy finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Damage-Free: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>| <strong>Reusable:</strong> No | <strong>Customizable:</strong> Yes, multiple sizes, shapes, and colors |<strong> Finish:</strong> Varies, some matte, some glossy |<strong> Adhesive:</strong> Pre-glued adhesive gel on each nail |<strong> Included Tools: </strong>Prep pad, nail file, wood stick</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designs-paint-lab-press-on-nails></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Designs</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paint Lab Press-On Nails</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paint Lab Wild Ones" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/o8oEvCBZ6LIOZIxK5rqMek_3D4k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paint-lab--wild-ones-3637880099554aff9fb5d680db045f9e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paint Lab</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Look</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>They come in an array of whimsical designs and bold colors.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite thorough hand washing, these nails stayed in place.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They are easy to apply and have a seamless look.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With more than 30 different press-on nail designs in an assortment of bold and brilliant colors, PaintLab has a nail set for each taste preference.

After thorough hand washing, these talons did not come off.

Reals also appreciated the "on-trend designs" and how you can easily clip them to your desired length. These nails are also super durable. "Mine always last about two weeks from when applied, but after the first week, it's easier to remove (just by peeling them) if you do want to take them off," she says.

Durability generally has to do with the strength of the adhesive (either glue or a sticker backing!) and the material of the nail itself. For instance, a sticker nail won’t last as long as a thicker nail applied with glue. Our pick from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Chillhouse Nails</a> lasted for two weeks while our senior commerce editor was traveling, so we’d support the claim that these nails are quite durable.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Damage Control</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the best perks of press-on nails is that they generally cause less damage to your nails than acrylics, gel, or powder manicures, which is what we love about the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ManiMe Press-On Gels</a>. That’s because most of these nails can peel off after soaking them for about 15 minutes in warm soapy water and using a small wooden tool to lift the edge. Mind you, take caution when showering for the same reason — the hot water can loosen the adhesive. Hack: To remove excess glue, wrap an acetone-soaked cotton round around your fingertip for 20 minutes (using tin foil or something to keep it in place).

If you're going for stylish talons, you might prefer stiletto or ballerina-shaped nails, whereas a shorter rounded or square nail might be best for those doing more work with their hands. Gerstein says press-on nails "also make great blank canvases for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>DIY nail art</a>," so if you're feeling crafty, you might want a longer nail to create more space.

"Like any manicure, pushing back cuticles and making sure the nail is free of oil, lint, and dust is important," she says. "Always swipe with alcohol and let nails dry before applying tabs/glue. Tabs are for temporary wear, [and] glue, if applied correctly, can get up to 2.5 weeks of wear." As far as removal goes, Gerstein suggests clipping the press-on down to the size of your natural nail and soaking it in acetone for 10 minutes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Tamara Staples</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-press-on-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Press-On Nails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team enjoyed a day of grooming and manicures trying out 13 sets of press-on nails in our testing lab.
