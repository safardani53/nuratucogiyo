Karlissa Saffold, wildly suggested that Blueface and <a href=#>Chrisean</a> could be related but didn't show any proof of her accusation.</p><p><a aria-label="In a video (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In a video</a>, Saffold said that Chrisean's mother's last name is Dorsey, supposedly the same surname of other people in Saffold's family.</p><p>"Chrisean momma is a Dorsey," said Saffold. "She a Dorsey."</p><p>Saffold didn't explain who in her family had the last name and neither she nor Blueface share that name.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE BLUEFACE">READ MORE BLUEFACE</h2><p>She went on to claim that all Dorseys have similar personalities.</p><p>"I bet you we need to test the baby," Saffold said of the newborn Blueface and Chrisean share.</p><p>Neither Blueface nor Chrisean have responded to Saffold's wild claim.</p><h2>MOMMY DEAREST</h2><p>Blueface has had a long history of strife with his mother, whom he said has caused irreparable damage in his life.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>In 2019, Blueface infamously kicked his mother and sister out of his <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> home, removing their belongings when one of his then-girlfriends reportedly refused to greet Saffold.</p><p>The rapper's sister, Kali, recorded the incident on Instagram Live, showing Blueface confronting her and their mother.</p><p>The video shows Blueface seemingly kicking at one of the women before throwing their stuff out the door.</p><p>Blueface shared surveillance footage of the confrontation and explained that his sister came to his home unannounced and argued with him as his young son was present.</p><p>"Sense [sic] they wanna go viral so bad this the real story my mom got tired of my broke a** sister free loading at her house so she brought her to mine an I wasn’t going for it," he said.</p><p>"I already got her an apartment guess that wasn’t enough she want my car she want me to buy her a car off the lot an some more stuff."</p><p>As for his mother, Blueface explained that he wasn't allowed to stay at her home in the past and was forced to live out of his car.</p><p>"I was homeless in my own car for years ain’t nobody wanna let me stay at they house I had to thug it out."</p><p>Last year, <a href=#>Blueface slammed his mother</a> after she made more wild claims about his supposed treatment toward Christean.</p><p>In an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;Story seen by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HipHopDX</a>, Saffold claimed: "Dam the whole family prostituting this poor girl. Now I feel bad for real.</p><p>"Y'all sent this girl back here knowing she's in harms way! I bet not here nothing about the next episode from none of y'all.</p><p>"That girl old enough to know that's not love. Bobby didn't love Whitney a.. neither. They see a couple [of] dollars and think that's love (sic)."</p><p>Blueface responded: "None my mom say (sic) is true. I don't even know that lady anymore I lost her to the internet."</p><p>Saffold hit back, saying: "You're done, you had one job and that was to open the gate for those of us who earned it. You couldn't even do that."</p><h2>DISOWNED</h2><p>Earlier this year, Blueface said in an interview that he doesn't have a mother.</p><p>"F**k that lady," he said.</p><p>"I don't have a mom. She's weird, she's strange. I don't know what her motive is, her angle. I don't know what she's trying to accomplish with her outreaches and whatever she does.</p><p>"I really don't care for her. She's not in my best interest so what can I do with that?"</p><p>Shortly after making those comments, Saffold responded on <a href=#>social media</a>, explaining that she would no longer pray for her son.</p><p>"This ninja said F everyone but the people who leeching off him. You are the world’s biggest weirdo. When they done with you I pray you ask God for forgiveness.</p><p>"He don’t have a dad. He don’t have a BM. He don’t have a brother. He don’t have a sister. He don’t have a granny. He don’t have a friend. He don’t have a God.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"But I’m weird. Everyone else the problem but you @bluefasebabyy. I’m done with you.
