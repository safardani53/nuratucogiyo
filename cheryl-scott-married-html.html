For someone who analyzes the sky from the ground below, Cheryl's lover Dante <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a> to her from above the clouds atop&nbsp;Haleakala, Hawaii.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Cheryl, who currently works as a lead meteorologist for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ABC 7 Eyewitness News</a> in Chicago got <a href=# rel=follow>engaged to her long-time boyfriend Dante Deiana</a>, a DJ and music programmer back in July 2018. In a recent post, Cheryl <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reminisced</a> her picturesque proposal on the occasion of the couple's two-year engagiversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>An Above the Sky Proposal that Left Cheryl on Cloud Nine</h2><p>Dante, who also serves as the Director of Marketing and Entertainment for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forward Hospitality Group</a> and&nbsp;co-owns a bar, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Uproar Chicago</a>, made sure that his proposal to Cheryl was out of the world. In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a> penned by Dante himself, he talks about partnering with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Engaged on Maui</a>, a proposal planning and photography company, to exceed Cheryl's expectations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the same blog, Dante&nbsp;recollects how the proposal took almost a year of planning and why he had decided to do it on top of Mount Haleakala in Hawaii that had the other tourists swooning. According to him, Cheryl had always wanted their engagement to be special, which is why Dante had given his proposal considerable thought.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo had been eyeing a holiday to Hawaii for quite some time before 2018 when Dante finally got the idea working out. However, his plan took a lot of time to come to fruition. The Weathercaster's boyfriend had to reschedule his proposal multiple times given&nbsp;a few tropical storms&nbsp;when&nbsp;he finally got to ask Cheryl to marry him under the sun shining with a spectacular view behind, as his evident from the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> beautiful photos</a> published with the blog.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although it has been more than two years since the engagement, Cheryl and Dante haven’t revealed anything about when they will be getting married. For now, they just love sharing sweet exchanges on their social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Cheryl has been documenting fun instances of their relationship for her 83.3k followers on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>. She shared a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sweet photo </a>of her with Dante and their dog celebrating Thanksgiving together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Cheryl's Fiancé Has Other Surprises Up His Sleeves</h2><p>Dante loves giving surprises and in one of his biggest surprises, which was the proposal above the clouds, his lover Cheryl reportedly blacked out during the experience. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Baltimore Sun</a>, Cheryl Cole hadn't anticipated what was coming, as a result of which, she couldn't fully see the magical moment unfurl before her eyes. Fortunately, she was able to relive the moment, thanks to Dante, who had hired videographers to capture the occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from this, Dante loves surprising Cheryl every now and then. He just&nbsp;recently startled Cheryl with some dance moves which she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared </a>on her social media exclaiming how much she loved it. Apparently, Cheryl had no idea that Dante was covertly practicing ball dance and was floored when he suddenly sneaked up on her with his moves.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This little SNEAK surprises me with a Dance he’s been learning over the past couple of months (which I knew nothing about)!</p><p>Likewise, the couple enjoys each other's company doing a lot of fun and quirky kinds of stuff. Like the time, when Dante shared a post, where he and Cheryl can be seen rolling on the floor, with the caption "Pretty Normal Saturday Night."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Even during restrictive circumstances following the pandemic, the couple makes the most from what they can, as is evident from Cheryl's post when she wished her base happy birthday saying that she would surprise him as he deserved after the COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Married or not, it looks like Dante and Cheryl are fully committed to weathering any storms together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Cheryl Scott Is Also Keeping Busy Professional</h2><p>Cheryl is going strong as the lead meteorologist for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ABC 7 Eyewitness News</a>. Not long ago, in November 2020, she covered the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chicago storms</a> that caused much damage. And, rightfully so her efforts have been quite fruitful&nbsp;as Abc 7 Chicago recently picked up an Emmy award for their 2019 NYE show. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apart from her regular shows, Cheryl along with ABC 7 Chicago has partnered up with National Geographic for a new five-part series about saving the Great Lakes. The documentary series titled <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">"So Great, So Fragile”</a>&nbsp;dives deep into threats being faced by North America’s lakes.</p><p>With this series, Cheryl Scott has firmly placed herself as one of the most sought out meteorologists committed to using her platform and knowledge to fight climate change.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But using her expertise in meteorology and geology isn’t the only way Cheryl is helping out for the greater good. She is also involved in a number of philanthropic works. She has been volunteering with the American Red Cross since 2011, helping out those affected by weather-related disasters. Her videos on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tips on disaster prevention</a> can be found on her website and on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chicago Red Cross</a> YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1pr7YpWSsm5%2BpwW65wKupop2UY7W1ucs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-slams-vanderpump-rules-cast-james-kennedy-suck.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence SLAMS Vanderpump Rules Cast: James Kennedy SUCKS!</a>
