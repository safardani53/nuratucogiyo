The NFL player was briefly waived before landing a spot on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>main roster</a> in December 2021. At the time, he played the position of safety for the Texans — and Biles was his biggest fan. Currently, Owens is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a defensive back</a> for the Green Bay Packers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Forever cheering loud and proud for #36," Biles <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote on Instagram</a> in December 2021 to congratulate Owens on his first-ever career interception.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Olympian is a regular fixture at her husband's NFL games. After the 2020 Olympic Games were pushed back a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Biles <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> that getting to support Owens in person was one of the upsides of the postponement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2022, Biles showed up for Owens' team by appearing in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrity-filled video</a> ahead of the 2022-23 football season.

After that, the two started spending more time together, and the pandemic gave them the opportunity to really get to know each other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was one of the few times in her life where everything was just shut off and she couldn't do anything," Owens told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Texas Monthly</a> in June 2021.

"I just hadn't heard of her, and when I told her that, that's one of the things she liked."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>episode of Biles' docuseries</a>, Simone vs Herself, Owens said that one of the things he was most impressed by was Biles' commitment to her craft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Her work ethic was the first thing that caught my eye.
