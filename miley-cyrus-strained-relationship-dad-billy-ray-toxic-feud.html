her country music legend dad Billy Ray.</p><p><a href=#>The superstar</a> said she has <a href=#>struggled to see eye-to-eye with her famous father</a> because she was treated differently as the family navigated life in the public eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

out yesterday on Billy Ray’s birthday, Miley said: “My dad grew up the opposite of me.</p><p>“I grew up on a sound stage, like, in a house with a family that was super close and all lived under the same roof.</p><p>“And I grew up financially stable and emotionally stable, I think, in my relationships also.</p><p>“That’s something that my dad didn’t have. I’ve seen how that affects a lot of people that go from having nothing to everything. It’s a really dangerous place”.</p><p>Appearing on US TV special Endless Summer Vacation Backyard Sessions, Miley added: “So I think that’s where me and my dad’s relationship to fame and success is wildly different.</p><p>“Him feeling loved by a big audience impacted him emotionally more than it ever could me.</p><p>“When he feels special or important, it’s like healing a childhood wound, and I’ve always been made to feel like a star.</p><p>“It makes me emotional. So, I think that’s the difference.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p><a href=#>We told earlier this week how the Cyrus family had been torn apart by Billy Ray’s divorce from Miley’s mum Tish.</a></p><p>The split has left the family divided with Tish marrying Prison Break actor Dominic Purcell on Saturday, with Miley as her maid of honour and kids Brandi and Trace also in attendance.</p><p>Noticeably absent was Miley’s Grammy-nominated younger sister <a href=#>Noah</a> and brother Braison.</p><p>Hopefully this song helps to slowly bring the family back together.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Paul's biggest role yet</h2><p><a href=#>PAUL Mescal</a> is preparing for the biggest role of his career in <a href=#>Ridley Scott's Gladiator sequel.</a></p><p>The Normal People actor will play Lucius, the nephew of <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix’s</a> villain Commodus in the first film from 2000.</p><p>But Paul has laid down the law with his personal trainer and is refusing to quit his worst bad habits.</p><p>He told Esquire: “I set the tone early. I smoke and drink and that’s not going to change.</p><p>“I can’t tell you how stressed I am talking about that film in particular, because it’s definitely the biggest one I’ve done. I feel really excited.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Lilly leaves old haunt</h2><p><a href=#>LILY Allen</a> will be pleased to leave the drama of the past few weeks behind her.</p><p>The actress and singer wore a revealing silver lacy dress following a performance in West End play The Pillowman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/splashnews-com-splash-news-pictures-839996759.jpg><p>Earlier this month she was forced to halt her performance after someone became ill in the front row during the matinee.</p><p>And on Wednesday she had to flee with the cast after the Duke of York’s Theatre was evacuated – with fire engines rushing to the historic venue.</p><p>The theatre is said to be haunted by the ghost of its former manager Violet Melonette.</p><p>And given that’s two matinees interrupted, maybe she’s trying to say something...</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Shaggy no to tea weed</h2><p>SHAGGY has insisted he rarely touches weed and slammed claims he likes to sprinkle it in his tea.</p><p>For decades, Mr Bombastic has been linked to his alleged love of the green stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shaggy-attends-bad-like-brooklyn-825003090.jpg><p>But now the rapper, who is due to play the Notting Hill Carnival in <a href=#>London</a> on Monday, said: “I never said I put it in my tea. I don’t drink weed in my tea. I don’t even smoke. I might have an occasional puff here and there in a social environment with my friends but nothing of that nature.</p><p>“I’m not an avid weed smoker. I don’t have anything against anyone that smokes weed. I’m from Rastafarian family and my uncles are all Rastafarians and I’ve been raised around it all my life.”</p><p>He’s cleared that up then.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Robbie back in UK for good</h2><p><a href=#>ROBBIE Williams</a> is finally settling into life back in London after admitting he felt homeless earlier this year.</p><p>I’ve been told the Angels singer has been spending more time in the capital with wife <a href=#>Ayda Field</a> and their four children, after years of moving around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/robbie-williams-attends-chopard-art-826603558-1.jpg><p>A source said: “Robbie has made no secret of the fact he’s a bit of a nomad and doesn’t like the pace of life in London or <a href=#>Los Angeles.</a></p><p>“But now it seems he has settled on London and they are spending more time here as a family.</p><p>“They have moved into his £17.5million house and will be using it as their base for the time being.”</p><p>In September, the former Take That star said he was trying to compromise with Loose Women panellist Ayda about where the family would eventually call home.</p><p>He said: “My wife insists our oldest, and all of our children, should experience some kind of high school.</p><p>“I don’t believe in that. But she does. So by the time Teddy is 13 we have to be somewhere. We have three years.</p><p>“It is difficult to know what to do, my job doesn’t exist anywhere – it is everywhere. I love my job, I love providing but I don’t want my daughter to be 22 and never have met me.</p><p>“So that is another part of the equation I am trying to work out.”</p><p>Earlier this year Robbie put his three homes in Los Angeles, <a href=#>Wiltshire</a> and <a href=#>Switzerland</a> on the market and has banked millions selling them.</p><p>All the more time to find a new place when he tires of living in the capital again.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Glad Lew's on point again</h2><p>I’M happy to see <a href=#>Lewis Capaldi</a> pointing in the right direction after a rough few

see him struggling.</p><p>Lewis, who has <a href=#>Tourette’s syndrome</a>, later cancelled 24 shows on his Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent tour.</p><p>Lewis said at the time: “It became obvious that I need to spend much more time getting my mental and physical health in order.”</p><p>Your millions of fans can wait for as long as it takes, Lew.</p><img

Waititi.</a></p><p>Sharing the snap online, Rita said: “More incredible memories”.</p><p>Next month she plans to head back into the studio and <a href=#>begin work on her fourth album</a>.</p><p>Unlike her third record You & I, which she dropped last month, Rita promises the next offering will see her return to her dance roots.</p><p>Some of her biggest hits have been
