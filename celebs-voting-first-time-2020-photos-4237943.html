The 19-year-old actor — who plays Lucas Sinclair — was eligible to vote in his first presidential election. He showed off his milestone achievement as a first-time voter with two Instagram photos, showing him wearing a sticker reading “I’m a Georgia Voter” inside of a peach drawing, with “I secured my vote” underneath. He then did a dance to <strong>Earth Wind and Fire</strong>‘s “Can’t Hide Love” outside of his car with his sticker proudly displayed on his white t-shirt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>James Broderick&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>, 55, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matthew Broderick</strong></a>, 58, were spotted taking their son <strong>James</strong>, 18, out to vote for the first time on Election Day in New York City. It appears the trio all voted at the same time as they entered the same building and came out with “I Voted” stickers proudly displayed on their shirts. All three of them wore face masks and Sarah and James both wore matching tops that appeared to show their support for Democratic presidential nominee Biden and his running mate <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sarah-Jessica-Parker-Matthew-Broderick-vote-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The election comes just a few days after James turned 18 on Oct. 28. His loving mom <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>took to social media</a> to send him well wishes and express her excitement about his new voting age. “On this day, you are 18 years old. I marvel at the passing of those years but equally the young man you are becoming,” she wrote alongside a bunch of cute young pics of James. “My love for you is an ache and an honor. As you leap toward and into your future, I remain your privileged and steadfast confident and joyful witness to the year ahead. Happy birthday my first time voter.

Selena confessed in an October 24 Voting Power Hour appearance that the 2020 presidential election is the first time she’s ever casted a ballot. Honestly, I’m not ashamed to say this,” the singer said when a caller asked her about her first time voting. “But… I’m kind of… This was my first time. I’m going to say that, because I’ve never felt — and this is so true, and I’m now admitting it to people — like my vote counts. Every vote counts.

But proud.” She also got in on the joke, posting the same pic to her page and writing, ““It was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ryan’s first time</a>. He was understandably scared.

Im not proud of it, but my naivety has kept me sheltered through a lot of my young adult life. BUT. As I’ve listened and learned, I’ve realized its our responsibility and privilege to use our voices to establish what we as human beings with beating hearts want to see in this country for not only ourselves…but our friends, neighbors, strangers, and future generations. The political climate this election is intense. It can feel really overwhelming and scary to even have an opinion, knowing if you share it you will get ruthlessly criticized regardless of your platform or perspective. There’s a lot of noise…but I’ve learned that’s when it’s most important to be anything but silent. And our vote is our voice. America stands for so many beautiful things and I hope (and vote) that it continues to evolve and grow to be a place where EVERYONE is protected, respected, and given equal rights and opportunity. Left the polls feeling really empowered by exercising my right and showing up for what I believe in and the change I want to see. I encourage everyone to do the same. 🗳</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kelsea Ballerini</a> (@kelseaballerini) on Oct 16, 2020 at 3:19pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Country music star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a> is also voting for the first time this year.
