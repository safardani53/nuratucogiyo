that&nbsp;<a href=#>Maralee</a>'s "medical reason" for having designated induced labor earlier this month was <a href=#>due to a sexually transmitted disease.</a></p><img

LA-based personal trainer, who gave birth to a son on December 1, fired back at his accusations, but the rumors left his ex <a href=#>Khloe</a> "shaken" after he allegedly cheated on her.</p><p>The insider said: "More than anything, Khloe is most disturbed that Tristan says he didn't know the other woman well, but knew her well enough to be with her unprotected.</p><p>"As the reality of what happened dawned on her that has shaken her up the most because he potentially could have put her health at risk.</p><p>"Fortunately, Khloe and Tristan are both healthy but his constant stepping out has made her realize how risky it is to be with him when they reunite.</p><p>"There's no turning back. She's been fooled for the last time and won't let anyone put her happiness or health in danger."</p><p>The source added that Khloe, 37, is "angry" but not letting her emotions get in the way of co-parenting her three-year-old daughter True with <a href=#>Tristan</a>, who remains her primary focus.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>A separate source close to Khloe insisted her and Tristan, 30, broke up many months ago and he gave his deposition earlier this summer, adding: "While the news is out now does not mean it's new to Khloe."</p><p>The Sun has reached out to Khloe's rep for comment.</p><p>Khloe appeared to break her silence recently in a tweet, telling critics: "I'm barely in my own body right now. Please don't read into anything. Also please don't tear me apart because you assumed something."</p><p>Court documents leaked to Daily Mail read: "Since opening up our private files to the media, I have been contacted by a source confirming that I should be checked because Petitioner [Maralee] has been diagnosed with herpes.</p><p>"Therefore, it would make sense that Petitioner had to have a designated delivery date."</p><p>The filing goes on to claim that the Sacramento Kings star was not the only athlete who was involved with Maralee.</p><p>"Petitioner told me that she had been involved with other athletes and understood the limitations of our relationship; to-wit, that we might see each other on a sporadic basis for consensual casual sex only," Tristan claimed.</p><h2><strong>MARALEE SOUNDS OFF</strong></h2><p>Maralee blasted the allegations about her health and countered: "I was induced on November 29, 2021 because I had a placenta abnormality."</p><p>She went on: "I would never have gotten involved with Tristan if I thought he was in a relationship," adding that she thought he was "single and co-parenting" in reference to&nbsp;<a href=#>his relationship with Khloe.</a></p><p>She continued: "Tristan told me&nbsp;<a href=#>he was not having a sexual relationship with anyone else</a>; it was not casual sex nor did we have any arrangement.</p><p>"Tristan and I communicated daily and talked on the phone. We would see each other several times a month," she added. "He invited me to see him Christmas, New Year's, and his birthday."</p><p>Maralee added: "I gave birth on December 1, 2021. Instead of focusing on any negativity, I am choosing to embrace being a mother and doing the best I can for my son.</p><h2><strong>SECRET HOOKUPS</strong></h2><p>"I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with Tristan. My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment."</p><p>Tristan has claimed in court documents that his relationship with Maralee, 31, began as a series of hotel hook ups over the course of four months and were communicated via Snapchat, where he used the name "blkjesus00."</p><p>Maralee <a href=#>filed the lawsuit</a> against her alleged baby daddy on June 30, just days after moving from Texas to Los Angeles.</p><p>She requested child support as well as "reimbursement of medical expenses and pregnancy-related costs such as Lamaze classes, a doula, and prenatal vitamins."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In the papers, Maralee has also asked that Tristan pay for costly items needed after the baby's birth, including "clothing, formula, and diapers."</p><p>Tristan has not denied that he is the baby boy's father but requested that a paternity test be completed after the child's birth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698752066-23.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000689538672-13.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000662220183-7.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tristan Thompson begs Khloe Kardashian to get back with him as fans slam cheating baby daddy as 'straight up clown'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY2Z9dIOTaKKhpJ%2Baeqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtuwNGiqq2ZnmLBqbvMqaqopl2ntrS3jKaYq5mcmrJuusicn6iko2K1pr7Pnqpo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./first-ever-cannabis-easter-egg.html>&#171;&nbsp;UKs first ever legal cannabis Easter egg sells out despite 18.99 price tag The Sun</a>
