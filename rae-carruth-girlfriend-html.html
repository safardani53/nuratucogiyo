Their first encounter came about at a pool party.&nbsp;</p><p>The two supposedly hit it off, and Cherica&nbsp;was already expecting a child by April next year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rae Carruth Had a Son with Ex-Girlfriend</h2><p>This was not Carruth's first pregnancy. He was still paying child support to a former girlfriend,&nbsp;Michelle Wright, for their son Raelondo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Some sources cite that Carruth was once sued for not paying child support.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Whatever be the case, he was already a father of one, soon to be a father of two. However, he was not too keen about having a child with Cherica, at least not then.&nbsp;</p><p>So, he asked her to abort. Sadly, she refused. She decided to keep the life growing inside of her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Little did she know that her boyfriend was hell-bent on that abortion. So much so that he didn't care if she died in the process.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Ominous Day</h2><p>On November 16, 1999, when Cherica was eight months pregnant, she was shot four times in the stomach with a .357 caliber revolver.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She somehow managed to call 911 to the former NFL receiver's residence in Charlotte, North Carolina. Alas, the damage had already been done.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Authorities later determined that Carruth had hired a hitman,&nbsp;Van Brett Watkins Sr., to murder his girlfriend while he watched.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="follow noopener">Insider</a> reported that Cherica was driving her car when the harrowing fate befell the mother-to-be.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She was rushed to a medical facility, and after an emergency cesarian section, their son Chancellor Lee was born.</p><p>However, because of his premature birth and the severity of his mother's injuries, he was born with a condition called cerebral palsy. The lack of oxygen had caused permanent brain damage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The girlfriend went into a coma and passed away a month later.&nbsp;</p><p>For his heinous crime, Carruth was sentenced to 18 to 24 years in prison. After serving his sentence, he was released in October 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Son Survived&nbsp;</h2><p>Chancellor lives by his grandmother and Cherica's mother, Sandra Adams, and is not just surviving but thriving.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Chancellor Lee Adams with his grandmother Sandra Adams</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Although the teenager will not be able to live on his own, he has shown improvement in aspects that his doctors deemed impossible, including&nbsp;walking with assistance and talking with everyone he meets. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was aware of all the "never" placed upon his being in his early years. He was never supposed to walk, talk, sit up, or even feed himself. Still, he had faith.&nbsp;</p><p>"Because of my strong faith, I heard what they were saying. But I said: 'I know there’s a miracle worker, and he is going to be my miracle boy,'" he once said.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you know?
