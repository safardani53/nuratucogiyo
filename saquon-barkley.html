Furthermore, Saquan is one of five children of his parents.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unsurprisingly, Barkley is not the only athlete in his family. His father, Alibay, was a gifted boxer until his injury halted his career. He was only 19 when he was arrested on a gun charge and spent a year in Rikers Island prison.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While his uncle, Iran Barkley, is a three-time award-winning boxer.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Saquoan and his family relocated to the Pennsylvania town of Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley in search of a safe community. They were rich even though they were immigrants.&nbsp;</p><p>Following their son’s selection by the New York Giants, his parents were pleased to know that he was living nearby while playing professional football.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Saquon’s father admits that leaving the Bronx was one of the best decisions he made in his life.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JQ3EU7MK6RCSRK2IJB643XM64Y.jpg><p>In an interview with AFMZ, his mother, Tonya, said that her son will gain from the game not just for himself but also for his family and close friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Saquan’s younger brother Alibay Jr. is a star baseball player at George Washington High School in New York City and later got drafted by Los Angeles Angels.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Saquon attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania. He played for his high school team from his sophomore to senior year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During this time, he rushed 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And subsequently, this earned Barkley a four-star recruit to Pennsylvania State University.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While attending Penn State, he also participated in world-class education. Barkley knows that he cannot play football forever. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As his position is running back, the average career for it is shorter than in any other place.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Therefore he is doing the second thing he loves to do. He is pursuing his bachelor’s degree in Communications. A communication degree is just one way of staying close to football.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SN2EI5NT2FBJXCL3ZBBUCNXGGI.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Balancing his grades is not a big problem for him. In an interview, his coach James Franklin said that Barkley’s GPA is over 3.0, and he was named the team’s “Leadership Council” during his sophomore.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Saquon has a record of participating in more than 2,000 hours of community service. However, he dropped out during his studies due to conflicting schedules.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2018, he declared that he would return to Penn State. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penn State holds a special place for Saquon Barkley, as he met his girlfriend and the mother of his daughter there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In an interview, Barkley said that he wants his daughter to be proud of him and show that he is much more than just a football player.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His talent is not limited only to football. At Whitehall, he also played track and field and basketball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Barkley has won gold medals in the long jump and 100-meter dash, setting its record.</span></p><h2>Saquon Barkley | Career</h2><p>Coming from a sports background, Barkley has always been interested in sports. His father urged him to follow in his footsteps and opt for boxing.</p><p>But the heart wants what it wants, right? Boxing never interested him as football did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1437766076.jpg.png><p>Thus, he followed his passion instead of his father. The American football running back is blessed to have a father like him who does not force him to do anything he doesn’t want.</p><p>Saquon was given the freedom to make his own decision.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Barkley played for three seasons for Penn State during his time at the University.</p><h4>Freshman year</h4><p>During his first year at Penn State, his excellent performance earned him the “Big Ten Network- Freshmen of the Year” award.</p><p>In his second game as a freshman, he rushed for 115 yards with a touchdown, followed by 195 yards and two touchdowns in his third game against Rutgers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/29329886132_bdf72bd1bd_b.jpg><p>But sadly, he missed the other two games due to injury. In his freshman year alone, he rushed 1,076 yards, despite missing several vital competitions. This record broke the freshman record of D.J. Dozier.</p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sophomore year</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unsurprisingly, his sophomore year proved to be even more fruitful. Saquon’s first game was against Kent State, where he rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33-13 win game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He rushed a total of 1,496 yards during his sophomore year. On November 3, 2016, Saquon was named a semi-finalist for the Maxwell Award, given to the all-around best collegiate football year of the year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the regular season, Barkley was also the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The football running back had 25 carries for 194 yards averaging 7.8 yards per carry, which gave Penn State a 28-27 win in the 2017 Rose Bowl on January 2.</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Junior year</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The amount of effort Barkley puts into a game can never be unnoticed. Despite his underwhelming games a few times, he was named “co-Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For his final college game, Barkley rushed 137 yards and two touchdowns, leading the victory of Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl Victory.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/d7193a56c3b4305409550cb80bf3412c.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He rushed a total of 1,271 yards in his full junior year. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aft three years, Saquon decided to leave college for the 2018 NFL draft.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although he left college, he promised his parents and coach that he would return and complete his degree.</span></p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Leaving college must have been a difficult decision for him. But the decision was all worth it as New York Giants Barkley selected him with the No.2 overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft.</p><p>After being drafted, Barkley signed a four-year deal on July 22, 2018. This deal was worth $31.2 million with $20.76 million as a signing bonus, $31m guaranteed, and an average salary of $7.79 million.&nbsp;</p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2018 Season</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although the first two weeks of his NFL were a loss, Barkley set a new record for 14 receptions, making an all-time franchise record for most catches in a single game.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Saquon recorded 82 passing yards, rushed touchdowns, and caught five passes for 35 yards in a 27-22 victory against Houston, Texas, in Week 3.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In Week 11, Barkley set his career-high record, rushing 142 yards with three touchdowns as Giants won against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/asdfghnm.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For all his effort during his rookie season, the American running back was given NFL Rookie of the Year, Pepsi Rookie of the Year, and FedEx Ground NFL Players of the Year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, he was named PFWA All-Rookie Team, which recognizes outstanding rookies for each position. And lastly, Saquon has also been named on AP All-Rookie teams, awarded by Associated Press.</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2019 Season</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2019 proved as a successful rookie year for Barkley. His teammates chose him as one of the seven team captains for 2019.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his third week against Tampa Bay, he sprained his high ankle and only returned in the seventh week. He made his remarkable return by rushing 72 yards and touchdowns in the Gaints’ 27-21 loss.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/saquon-barkley-main-1234.webp><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In his seventeenth week for NFL, Barkley rushed 17 times for 92 yards, including a season-long 68-yard run that resulted in a touchdown, leading him to win the NFC Offensive Player of the week.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Barkley finished his 2019 season by creating a history of 1,000 rushing yards for the Giants in two seasons. He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2020 Season</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2020 has not been so great for Barkley. In week one against Pittsburgh Steelers, he rushed only 0.4 yards per attempt, making his career-low stat since making his debut.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But most importantly, Barkley’s biggest unfortunate event came in the second week. He met with a significant knee injury which ended his whole season.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/usa_today_14955996.0.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The MRI confirmed that he had torn his ACL and would undergo surgery. Barkley is no stranger to injury; in fact, no athletes are. But this was a massive blow, as this caused him to miss the rest of the season.</span></p><h4>2021 Season</h4><p>On April 28, 2021, the Gainst picked the fifth-year contract option on Barkley’s contract, which was worth $7.217 million for the 2022 season.&nbsp;</p><p>Saquon again got injured in Week 5 against Dallas Cowboys, where his foot landed on Jourdan Lewis and rolled his ankle. Later, he was also listed in the NFL’s Covid protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>The American football running back had 593 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 41 receptions, and two receiving touchdowns in 13 games.&nbsp;</p><p>2022 Season&nbsp;</p><p>Barkley rushed for 164 yards and a touchdown and made six passes in the 21-20 comeback win against Tennessee Titans in Week 1.</p><p>His performance resulted in him receiving the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.</p><p>In Week 3, Saquon had 126 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown that gave them a loss against the Cowboys.&nbsp;</p><p>Saquoan made 146 rushing yards in the 20-12 victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 4.&nbsp;</p><h2>Saquon Barkley | Awards And Accomplishments</h2><p>Here are some of the career awards and achievements Barkley has received from his successful Career.</p><p>2022: 2X Pro Bowl</p><p>2018: NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year</p><p>2017: Consensus All-American, Paul Hornung Award, Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year, Rodgers-Dwight Return Specialist of the Year, First-team All-Big Ten</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/asdfgbnm.png><p>2016: Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year, First-team All-Big Ten</p><p>2015: Second-Team All-Big Ten&nbsp;</p><p>2014: Mr. Pennsylvania Football&nbsp;</p><h2>Saquon Barkley | Net Worth</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is no doubt that Barkley is famous and successful after checking his stats with the Giants.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After signing a four-year deal worth $31.2 million with Giants, h</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>is net worth is estimated to be <strong>$40 million</strong>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He also generates $4.5 million from endorsements deals like Nike, Pepsi, Visa, Toyota, Bose, and Dunkin Donuts. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Therefore, it is unsurprising that Forbes called Barkley a “marketing darling.”</span></p><p>The football player currently resides in Pennsylvania, United States, and owns a lavish house with various expensive cars.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Saquan Barkley | Girlfriend</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Barkley has been in a relationship with his beautiful girlfriend, <a href=# rel=noopener>Anna Congdon</a>.
